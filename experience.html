<p style="color : darkblue">My life has a lot of memorable moments that it is hard to choose which one to write about. I would have chosen to write about my my graduation day. We all know how graduation days are important to us and our family members. It is a landmark day that marks the end of a cycle, just like giving birth, exchanging vows on a wedding day and death. Although learning never ends, graduation marks the end of those grueling days we spent reading and internalizing loads of notes just to pass few questions that barely covered even a quarter of the curriculum.


The day was set for our graduation. It would occur during the week, which was contrary to the customs of the school, where graduation ceremonies were done on the weekends. My father had taken an impromptu leave from his job to ensure that he did not miss out on the big day. My sister bought a digital camera to capture all the fun moments, while my young sister and two brothers were more than enthusiastic to accompany us.


The day of my graduation is one of the best days of my life. On that day I realized that it does not matter where you come from, if you set your mind to do something nothing can stop you. Hard work pays and all dreams are possible. Always remember this that life is not measured by the amount of breaths you take, but by the moments that take you breath away.
